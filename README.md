### Probability Visualizer App

Welcome to the Probability Visualizer App! This application allows you to explore various probability distributions and visualize their outcomes through an intuitive and interactive interface. Whether you're a student learning about probability or a professional analyzing data, this app provides a powerful tool for understanding and experimenting with different distributions.

### Features:
- Multiple Probability Distributions: Explore a wide range of probability distributions, including normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential, and more.
- Interactive Visualization: Visualize the probability distribution functions (PDFs), cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), and probability mass functions (PMFs) in real-time, with customizable parameters.
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct basic statistical analysis such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and skewness for selected distributions.
- Customization: Adjust distribution parameters such as mean, standard deviation, rate, size, and shape to observe how they affect the distribution's shape and characteristics.
- Save and Share: Save your customized distributions for future reference or share them with others through unique URLs.

### Technologies Used:
- Backend: Python Flask API is used for the backend to handle requests and serve data to the frontend.
- Database: PostgreSQL is utilized for storing user data, preferences, and saved distributions.
- Frontend: React.js is employed for building the interactive user interface, allowing for seamless visualization and manipulation of probability distributions.

### Installation and Setup:
Clone the Repository:
Copy code
`git clone <repository-url>`

### Backend Setup:
- Navigate to the backend directory.
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set up PostgreSQL and create the necessary tables. Update the database configuration in config.py.
- Run the Flask server using python app.py.

### Frontend Setup:
- Navigate to the frontend directory.
- Install dependencies using npm install.
- Start the React development server using npm start.

### Accessing the App:
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
